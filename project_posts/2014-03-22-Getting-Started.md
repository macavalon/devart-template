Having chosen Google Dart to implement the Bifurcation Fractal drawing...
I needed to get access to Dart. A quick google got me to https://www.dartlang.org/
Once Dart tools were installed , I then familiarised myself with a canvas example "sunflower".

I then cloned, and modified to ensure I understood the drawing primitives.
This therefore is my first use of Dart

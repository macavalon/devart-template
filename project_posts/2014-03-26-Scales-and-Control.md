After achieving drawing of the bifuration fractal, I thought it only good to allow the user to control 
the view of the fractal!
I implemented additional sliders for control over the start and end point.

And to ensure understanding of what is being controlled, I've drawn an x-axis with the
"r" values labelled.

This now really allows you to explore the bifurcation fractal.

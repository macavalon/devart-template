I've now implemented a first cut of the Bifurcation plot or Logistic map(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map).

Basically this is a plot of the ![logistic equation](../project_images/logistic_equation.PNG?raw=true "logistic equation")

![1st Bifurcation test](../project_images/BifurcationTest1.PNG?raw=true "1st Bifurcation test")

I've also attempted to colour the plot, based on calculation of the Lyapunov_exponent (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyapunov_exponent)

This is of course very early stages!
